This repository demonstrates a common error in Perl: accessing an array element beyond its defined bounds. The `bug.pl` file contains the erroneous code, which attempts to access the fourth element of a three-element array.  The `bugSolution.pl` file provides a corrected version with error handling.  This example highlights the importance of bounds checking in array operations to prevent unexpected program behavior and crashes.
